    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground">Your Cleaning Business Needs More Than Just Word-of-Mouth Referrals</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In the cleaning industry, word-of-mouth referrals can only take you so far. To grow your business, you need a consistent flow of leads from <strong>Google searches</strong>, <strong>social media</strong>, and <strong>automated follow-ups</strong>. If your competitors are showing up in local searches and you're not, you're leaving money on the table.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">At Virsa Labs, we've helped cleaning companies in cities like <a href="/locations/digital-marketing-allentown-pa" class="text-primary hover:underline">Allentown, PA</a> and <a href="/locations/digital-marketing-bethlehem-pa" class="text-primary hover:underline">Bethlehem, PA</a> increase their visibility with <strong>Local SEO</strong>, improve their <strong>website performance</strong>, and implement <strong>automated systems</strong> that turn inquiries into paying clients.</p>

    <!-- Section 1: Local SEO — Get Found in Local Searches -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground flex items-center gap-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary/10 text-primary text-lg">1</span>
        Local SEO — Get Found in Local Searches
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Most cleaning service customers turn to <strong>Google</strong> when they need help. If your business isn’t showing up in the local pack for searches like “house cleaners near me” or “office cleaning services,” you're losing potential clients. Our <a href="/services/local-seo" class="text-primary hover:underline">Local SEO</a> strategies ensure your cleaning business appears at the top of local searches.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">We optimize your <strong>Google Business Profile</strong> with detailed service descriptions, high-quality photos, and accurate contact information to make it easy for potential clients to find and trust your business.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: Website SEO — Build Credibility and Convert Visitors -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground flex items-center gap-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary/10 text-primary text-lg">2</span>
        Website SEO — Build Credibility and Convert Visitors
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Your website is the <strong>digital storefront</strong> of your cleaning business. If it’s outdated, slow, or missing key information, potential clients will move on to a competitor. Our <a href="/services/website-seo" class="text-primary hover:underline">Website SEO</a> services ensure your site ranks well on Google and is optimized to convert visitors into paying clients.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">We make sure your website has clear calls to action, easy booking options, and detailed service pages that outline exactly what you offer. This builds <strong>trust and credibility</strong> with potential customers, turning casual visitors into loyal clients.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Business Automations — Save Time and Stay Organized -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground flex items-center gap-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary/10 text-primary text-lg">3</span>
        Business Automations — Save Time and Stay Organized
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Cleaning businesses lose leads when they don't follow up quickly. But manually tracking leads, sending quotes, and requesting reviews is time-consuming. That's where our <a href="/services/business-automations" class="text-primary hover:underline">Business Automations</a> come in.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">We set up <strong>automated follow-ups</strong>, <strong>appointment reminders</strong>, and <strong>review requests</strong> to ensure no lead slips through the cracks. Imagine a potential client finding your business in <a href="/locations/digital-marketing-philadelphia-pa" class="text-primary hover:underline">Philadelphia, PA</a>, submitting a form on your website, and receiving a follow-up message within minutes — all without you lifting a finger.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Reputation Management — Build Trust Through Reviews -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground flex items-center gap-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary/10 text-primary text-lg">4</span>
        Reputation Management — Build Trust Through Reviews
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Trust is everything in the cleaning business. Customers want to know they’re hiring someone reliable, trustworthy, and thorough. Positive online reviews are critical for building that trust. We help cleaning businesses automate <strong>review requests</strong> to boost their online reputation.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">With more <strong>5-star reviews</strong>, your business will stand out in searches and attract more clients. Our clients in cities like <a href="/locations/digital-marketing-newark-nj" class="text-primary hover:underline">Newark, NJ</a> have seen significant increases in leads after improving their online reputation.</p>

        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary/10 text-primary text-lg">5</span>
        PPC Advertising — Capture Leads Quickly
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">While SEO is essential for long-term success, <strong>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising</strong> is perfect for getting <strong>immediate results</strong>. We create targeted Google Ads campaigns that put your cleaning business at the top of search results, ensuring you're the first choice for potential customers.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">We’ve helped businesses in cities like <a href="/locations/digital-marketing-trenton-nj" class="text-primary hover:underline">Trenton, NJ</a> capture more high-value leads through <strong>geo-targeted ads</strong>, ensuring you’re only paying for clicks from customers in your service area.</p>
